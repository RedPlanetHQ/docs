# Obsidian CORE Sync Plugin

> Sync your Obsidian notes with [CORE](https://heysol.ai/core) (Contextual Observation & Recall Engine) and get **memory-aware answers** directly inside Obsidian.

---

## ‚ú® What it does

- **Sync Notes**: Push selected notes (or entire vault sections) into CORE as _Episodes_.
- **Right-Side Panel**: Opens a dedicated panel in Obsidian that sends the current note's content to CORE and shows **relevant results, links, or summaries**.
- **Frontmatter Control**: Decide which notes to sync by adding simple YAML flags.
- **Offline Safe**: Failed syncs are queued locally and retried automatically.
