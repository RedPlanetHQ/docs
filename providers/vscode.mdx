description: "Connect your VS Code editor to CORE's memory system via MCP"
---

### Prerequisites

- VS Code (version 1.95.0 or later) with GitHub Copilot extension
- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))
- [MCP support enabled](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers) in VS Code

### Step 1: Create MCP Configuration

1. **Create or open your MCP configuration file**:

   - Look for existing `mcp.json` file or create a new one in your user settings directory

2. **Add CORE MCP server configuration**:
   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "core-memory": {
         "url": "https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=Vscode",
         "type": "http"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 2: Authenticate with CORE

- Go to Extensions -> MCP Servers -> `core-memory` server
- Click on settings icon in core-memory server and start server
  ![Core vscode](/images/core-vscode-start-server.png)
- Allow domain core.heysol.ai to authenticate this MCP server
  ![Core vscode](/images/allow-domain.png)
- Select `MCP` when this is prompted on your screen
  ![Core vscode](/images/authenticate-vscode.png)
- Once authenticated, CORE Memory will show as a running MCP server

### Enable Automatic Memory Integration (Recommended)

Configure Copilot to automatically search and store memories for seamless project continuity

Create a new rules file in your project root:
.github/copilot-instructions.md

```text

I am Copilot, an AI coding assistant with access to CORE Memory - a persistent knowledge system that maintains project context across sessions.

**MANDATORY MEMORY OPERATIONS:**

1. **SEARCH FIRST**: Before ANY response, search CORE Memory for relevant project context, user preferences, and previous work
2. **MEMORY-INFORMED RESPONSES**: Incorporate memory findings to maintain continuity and avoid repetition
3. **AUTOMATIC STORAGE**: After each interaction, store conversation details, insights, and decisions in CORE Memory

**Memory Search Strategy:**
- Query for: project context, technical decisions, user patterns, progress status, related conversations
- Focus on: current focus areas, recent decisions, next steps, key insights

**Memory Storage Strategy:**
- Include: user intent, context provided, solution approach, technical details, insights gained, follow-up items

**Response Workflow:**
1. Search CORE Memory for relevant context
2. Integrate findings into response planning
3. Provide contextually aware assistance
4. Store interaction details and insights

**Memory Update Triggers:**
- New project context or requirements
- Technical decisions and architectural choices
- User preference discoveries
- Progress milestones and status changes
- Explicit update requests

**Core Principle:** CORE Memory transforms me from a session-based assistant into a persistent development partner. Always search first, respond with context, and store for continuity.
```

## What's Next?

With CORE connected to VS Code, your GitHub Copilot conversations will now:

- **Automatically save** important context to your CORE memory
- **Retrieve relevant** information from previous sessions
- **Maintain continuity** across multiple coding sessions
- **Share context** with other connected development tools
