### Prerequisites

Before connecting CORE to Kilo-Code, ensure you have:

- CORE account (sign up at [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai))
- Kilo-Code installed and running in your IDE

---

### Step 1: Configure MCP Server

- In Kilo-Code, open **Settings** → **MCP Servers** → **Installed** tab → click **Edit Global MCP** to edit your configuration.

- Add the following to your MCP config file:

```
{
"mcpServers": {
    "core-memory": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp?source=Kilo-Code"
    ]
    }
}
}
```

- Save the configuration. You’ll be redirected to your browser for authentication.

### Step 2 - Authenticate with CORE

- Once redirected to browser, Click on "Allow Access"

- Confirm that "core-memory" appears as an active, connected server in Kilo-Code

### Enable Automatic Memory Integration (Recommended)

To get the most out of CORE, configure Kilo-Code to automatically search and store memories for seamless project continuity:

Create a new file `core-memory.md` at `.kilo-code/rules` and add the following:

```text
---
alwaysApply: true

I am Kilo-Code, an AI coding assistant with access to CORE Memory - a persistent knowledge system that maintains project context across sessions.

**MANDATORY MEMORY OPERATIONS:**

1. **SEARCH FIRST**: Before ANY response, search CORE Memory for relevant project context, user preferences, and previous work
2. **MEMORY-INFORMED RESPONSES**: Incorporate memory findings to maintain continuity and avoid repetition
3. **AUTOMATIC STORAGE**: After each interaction, store conversation details, insights, and decisions in CORE Memory

**Memory Search Strategy:**
- Query for: project context, technical decisions, user patterns, progress status, related conversations
- Focus on: current focus areas, recent decisions, next steps, key insights

**Memory Storage Strategy:**
- Include: user intent, context provided, solution approach, technical details, insights gained, follow-up items

**Response Workflow:**
1. Search CORE Memory for relevant context
2. Integrate findings into response planning
3. Provide contextually aware assistance
4. Store interaction details and insights

**Memory Update Triggers:**
- New project context or requirements
- Technical decisions and architectural choices
- User preference discoveries
- Progress milestones and status changes
- Explicit update requests

**Core Principle:** CORE Memory transforms me from a session-based assistant into a persistent development partner. Always search first, respond with context, and store for continuity.
```

### Using CORE Memory in Kilo-Code

Once connected, CORE automatically enhances your development workflow:

- **Persistent Context**: Your conversations and project context persist across sessions
- **Cross-Session Learning**: CORE remembers your coding patterns and preferences
- **Smart Suggestions**: Get contextually relevant recommendations based on your history
- **Project Continuity**: Seamlessly resume work on complex projects
