CORE provides a powerful unified MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint that consolidates all your connected integrations into a single, easy-to-use interface for AI tools and applications.

## What is CORE's MCP Endpoint?

Instead of managing separate MCP connections for each integration (GitHub, Linear, Slack, etc.), CORE acts as an intelligent proxy that:

- **Consolidates Access**: One MCP URL provides access to all your connected integrations
- **Handles Authentication**: CORE manages all integration authentication behind the scenes
- **Provides Flexibility**: Configure which integrations are available per connection
- **Tracks Usage**: Monitor MCP connections and usage through the CORE dashboard

**Base MCP URL:**
```
https://core.heysol.ai/api/v1/mcp
```

## How It Works

### Traditional MCP Setup (Complex)
```
Your AI Tool → GitHub MCP Server (auth required)
Your AI Tool → Linear MCP Server (auth required)
Your AI Tool → Slack MCP Server (auth required)
```

### CORE MCP Setup (Simplified)
```
Your AI Tool → CORE MCP Endpoint → All Integrations (pre-authenticated)
```

With CORE, you authenticate once with each integration in the CORE dashboard, then access all tools through a single MCP endpoint.

## Key Benefits

### **Single Connection**
Connect your AI tools to one MCP endpoint instead of managing multiple connections and authentications.

### **Unified Authentication** 
CORE handles all integration authentication. No need to manage separate API keys or OAuth flows for each tool.

###  **Flexible Configuration**
Control which integrations are available per connection using query parameters, perfect for different use cases and environments.

### **Centralized Management**
Monitor all MCP connections, track usage, and manage access from the CORE dashboard.

### **Instant Availability**
New integrations you connect in CORE become immediately available through your existing MCP connections.

## Getting Started

1. **Connect Integrations**: Go to [CORE Dashboard](https://core.heysol.ai) → Integrations
2. **Enable MCP Access**: Click "Connect for MCP" on each integration
3. **Configure Your AI Tool**: Add CORE's MCP URL with desired parameters

## What's Available Through MCP

When you connect to CORE's MCP endpoint, you get access to:

### Integration Tools
All tools from your connected integrations:
- **GitHub**: Create issues, search repositories, manage pull requests
- **Linear**: Create and update issues, search projects, manage workflows  
- **Slack**: Send messages, search conversations, manage channels

### CORE Native Tools
- **Memory Search**: Query your memory graph and retrieve relevant context
- **Memory Ingestion**: Automatically capture and structure your work activities into your memory graph

## Use Cases

### Development Workflow
```
"Create a Linear issue for the authentication bug I just found"
"Search GitHub for similar issues in our repository" 
"Update the issue status to In Progress and assign it to me"
```

### Project Management
```
"Show me all Linear issues assigned to the frontend team"
"Create a GitHub issue and link it to Linear issue DEV-123"
"Send a Slack update to #engineering about the deployment"
```

### Research and Context
```
"Find all previous discussions about Redis performance in Slack"
"Search my memory for decisions related to database architecture"
"Show GitHub commits related to the authentication system"
```
