### Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Visit [core.heysol.ai](https://core.heysol.ai)
2. Sign up with your email

### Step 2: Add Your First Memory

1. Open the CORE chat interface
2. Tell CORE about yourself: "I'm a software engineer working on a React project called TaskMaster. I prefer TypeScript and use Tailwind for styling."
3. Type `add to memory` to save this context

### Step 3: See Your Memory Graph

1. Navigate to the Memory section
2. Watch as CORE visualizes your information as connected nodes
3. Notice how it links "React," "TaskMaster," and "TypeScript" together

### Step 4: Connect Your AI Tools

To enable cross-platform context, you need to connect CORE to your AI tools:

1. **Connect Claude**: [Claude MCP Setup Guide](/integrations/claude)
2. **Connect Cursor**: [Cursor MCP Setup Guide](/integrations/cursor)

This step takes 2-3 minutes per tool but unlocks CORE's full power.
