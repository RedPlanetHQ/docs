title: "Memory Graph"

CORE's memory graph is the foundation of how your digital brain works. Unlike traditional databases that store isolated facts, CORE creates a living network of connected information.

### How Your Memory is Structured

Your memory consists of three types of building blocks:

1. **Episodes - The raw conversations and interactions you have**

   - Every chat with Claude, message in Slack, or note you add becomes an episode
   - Episodes preserve the original context and serve as the source of truth

2. **Entities - The people, places, concepts, and relationships in your world**

   - Names like "Manik," concepts like "React," companies like "TaskMaster"
   - Even relationships like "works at" or "prefers" are treated as entities

3. **Statements - The specific facts extracted from your episodes**

   - "Alex works on TaskMaster" or "Manik prefers TypeScript"
   - Each statement knows when it became true and links back to its source episode

### Why This Structure Matters

This approach gives CORE unique advantages over simple note-taking or search systems:

- **Traceable Knowledge**: Every fact in your memory can be traced back to the original conversation where you mentioned it
- **Smart Connections**: When you mention "TaskMaster," CORE finds not just that word, but all related people, timelines, and decisions connected to your project
- **Evolving Understanding**: As you have more conversations, CORE builds richer connections between existing entities rather than creating isolated notes
