User rules let you control what information flows into your memory from connected integrations. Think of them as smart filters that work automatically in the background.

### How Rules Work

You describe what you want remembered using natural language:

- **Gmail Example**: "Only ingest emails marked as Important or from @company.com domains"
- **Slack Example**: "Only ingest messages that contain the ðŸ‘€ emoji"
- **GitHub Example**: "Only ingest pull requests I'm assigned to review"

### Creating Rules

Rules are created through simple natural language instructions in CORE's interface:

1. Connect an integration (Gmail, Slack, etc.)
2. Describe what should be remembered: "Remember all emails from my manager and any emails tagged as urgent"
3. CORE automatically applies this rule to future activity
