CORE integrations transform how you work with your essential tools by providing two powerful capabilities that work together to create a seamless AI-powered workflow.

## How CORE Integrations Work

### 1. Activity Ingestion to Memory

**Automatically capture and structure your work activities**

When you connect an integration to CORE, it begins monitoring your activities and intelligently adding them to your memory graph:

- **GitHub**: Commits, pull requests, issues, and code reviews become episodes in your memory
- **Linear**: Issues, comments, and project updates are preserved with full context
- **Slack**: Important conversations and decisions are captured and linked to relevant projects

**Smart Memory Rules**

You have complete control over what gets ingested into your memory. Using [User Rules](/integrations/user_rules), you can:

```txt
Only add Linear issues that are assigned to me
Ignore Slack messages from #random channel
Add all GitHub commits to the TaskMaster repository
```

This ensures your memory graph contains only the information that matters to you, creating a focused and relevant knowledge base.

### 2. MCP Connection

**Single endpoint for all your tool integrations**

Beyond memory ingestion, CORE acts as a unified MCP (Model Context Protocol) proxy, making all your connected integrations available through a single endpoint to your AI tools.

**Benefits:**
- **One Connection**: Connect once to CORE, access all your integrations
- **Universal Access**: Use the same integrations across Claude, Cursor, VSCode, and other AI tools
- **Simplified Authentication**: CORE handles all integration authentication for you

## Webhook Integration & Real-Time Events

CORE can stream your activities in real-time through webhooks, enabling powerful automation and real-time processing:

### Webhook Configuration

Activities are sent as events to your configured webhook endpoints, allowing you to:

- Build custom automation workflows
- Create real-time dashboards
- Integrate with other systems and tools
- Process activities through your own pipelines

### OAuth App Integration

Connect OAuth applications with webhook scope to receive authenticated activity streams. This enables:

- **Secure Access**: OAuth-protected webhook endpoints
- **Scoped Permissions**: Control exactly which activities are streamed
- **Real-Time Processing**: Immediate activity notifications for time-sensitive workflows

---

## Getting Started with Integrations

### Step 1: Connect Your Tools

1. Navigate to [CORE Dashboard](https://core.heysol.ai) **Integrations**
2. Select the platform you want to connect
3. Complete the OAuth authentication process
4. Configure your memory ingestion preferences

### Step 2: Set Memory Rules

Define what activities should enter your memory graph:

1. Go to **Settings** [**User Rules**](/concepts/user_rules)
2. Create rules to filter and control activity ingestion
3. Test your rules to ensure they capture the right information


## Benefits & Use Cases

### For Memory & Context
- **Persistent Project Knowledge**: Never lose track of decisions, discussions, and progress
- **Cross-Tool Recall**: Access project context from any AI tool or conversation
- **Smart Connections**: CORE links related activities across different platforms

### For MCP & Automation  
- **Unified Workflow**: Manage all integrations from one place
- **In-IDE Actions**: Create issues, update tasks, and query data without context switching
- **Real-Time Sync**: Webhook integration keeps everything up-to-date instantly

### Practical Example

When working on a feature, CORE automatically:

1. **Captures** your Linear issue assignment in memory
2. **Links** related GitHub commits and PR discussions  
3. **Provides** this context to Claude Code when you ask about the feature
4. **Enables** you to update the Linear issue status directly from your IDE
5. **Streams** all activities to your webhook for dashboard updates

This creates a seamless flow where your tools work together through CORE's intelligent coordination.
